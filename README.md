# Member Only!

This project builds a Rails application for an exclusive clubhouse where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

## Access hierarchy  

- Anonymous access: Access without a login will show all posts but with no possibility to show the Post's creator.
- User access: If a user signs up, all posts will be shown but with no option to show the Post's creator.
- Memeber access: Member rights are provided by an 'admin' user. After login as a member, all Posts and creator information is displayed.
- Admin: Full access.
